## About

**ssdwm** stands for ***Super Simple dwm***, or in expansion ***Super Simple Dynamic Window Manager***. 
It is a fork of <a href="https://dwm.suckless.org/">dwm</a>, a window manager 
for the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X_Window_System">X server</a>
which aims to have a greater degree of simplicity than other window managers
that include extra functionality “just in case” a user wants it. This extra 
software is usually called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_bloat">bloat</a> 
by some users, and it is precisely one of the strongest points of dwm that if
the user wants those features, he can add them himself.

**ssdwm** goes further, as it has the same goals as dwm but taken to the extreme, so that the 
user has a really minimalist experience.
